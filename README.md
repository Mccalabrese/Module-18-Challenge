## Project Sumary

In this project, I created a new data class named Record. This class serves as the template for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger stores.

I changed the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute thatâ€™s of type Record.

I created additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas collect the relevant information for each financial record that is stored in the PyChain ledger.

## Primary Code

All of the primary code is in pychain.py.
